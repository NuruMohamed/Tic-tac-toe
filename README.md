## What's new?

### I have added my own modifications. In addition, the tutorial ends with extra features to be added by the reader. Thus, so far I have added the following features: 
* Displayed the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
* Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
